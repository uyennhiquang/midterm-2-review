Unit 03 Practice Problems

The goal of these "mini practica" is to give you practice with coding problems
similar to those that you will see on the midterm practica. You will be 
required to solve each problem with minimal assistance. You should use these
mini-practica as an opportunity to gauge your preparedness for the exams.

You should create all of your required files in this folder along with these
instructions.

Each mini-practicum counts as a homework assignment. 
======================

0. Create a new package under unit04 named "practicum" and implement your 
   solution to the remaining problems in that package.

1. A fighter in the Spectacular Smoosh Bruhs (SSB) fighting game has the 
   following behavior:
   a. You can get the amount of damage of their next attack (a positive 
      integer). All fighters attack differently.
   b. You can deal an amount of damage to them (a positive integer). All 
      fighters take damage differently.
   c. A fighter is unconscious if health drops to 0.

   Create a new type to represent fighters.



2. Create a class that allows two SSB fighters to do battle in an arena.
   a. Battle continues as long as both fighters are conscious.
   b. During each round of battle, both fighters damage each other.
   c. At the end of battle, the winner is announced (using its toString()), 
      e.g. "Manio wins!" If both fighters are unconscious, it is a draw.


3. Use the table below to implement at least two fighters, each in its own 
   class. Then add a main method to your arena class and have the fighters do 
   battle. Each time the fighter attacks or is damaged, it should print a 
   message.

Manio (or    100     Jump Attack hits for       25% chance to dodge all

                     missiles for 75 
                     damage.

Lonk         150     Sword hits for 45          50% chance to block; damage
                                                reduced by half (rounded 
                                                down).

Mule Monkey  200     Bash has a 75% chance      If health is below 50, rage
                     to hit for 75, and a       causes damage taken to be 
                     25% chance to miss (0      reduced by 10.
                     damage)
