#### Housekeeping
- On monday: Create a bunch of images, empty buttons, create a panel of buttons, thinking about the observer pattern.

#### Notes

#### JavaFX
- **Event Handler**: an observer interface that must be implemented by classes that want to be notified when an event occurs.
  + There are 2 ways to implement this: long (triggered actions in a separate class) and short (lambda function; inline methods); the short way is limiting in its functionality (and you're not supposed to not have been taught them yet).

- **Things covered** (refer to the slides for syntax): textField, buttons, backgroundImages, eventHandler, stackPane, media
- VBox items don't grow vertically (and the same for HBox) by default. Use `VBox.setVgrow(<Java Control to be grown>, Priority.ALWAYS)` to make all VBoxes with this control have that specific control grow vertically.

#### Model view controller
- Using a game as an example, the game logic/state is the **model**, then you put the visible aspects GUI/CLI (aka the "**view**") on top of the model, and the **controllers** are what give the model the input, that may affect the view.
